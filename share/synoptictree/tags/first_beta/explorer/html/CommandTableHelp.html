<h2>Command Table</h2>

The command table consists of a table with commands. The rows in the
table can be selected and when selected and right-clicked, a
popup-menu will appear.
<br>
This popup-menu gives you these choices:
<ul>
<li>Remove - removes the current attribute. This item is only
available in <a href="MainHelp.html#administrator-mode">administrator-mode</a>
<li>Remove all - removes all attributes from the table. This item is
only available in <a href="MainHelp.html#administrator-mode">administrator-mode</a>
<li>View - which lets you choose which fields to view
<li>Status - which opens a window with the status of the corresponding
device.
<li>Run Jive - which lets you start Jive, a program used to configure
devices. This item is only enabled if jive is available to the Device Tree
<li>Run ATKpanel - which lets you start ATKPanel on the device of this
attribute. This item is only enabled if ATKPanel is available to the
Device Tree.
<li>Run - which lets you run a predefined application on the device of
this command.
<li>Execute - which lets you execute the command. If the command needs
input from the user or gives output, an appropriate window will be
shown. If not, the command is executed in silence.
<li>Help - shows this help
</ul>
When the application is set to refresh, the device field will change
colour depending on the state of the device of the command. The name
of the state is avialable as a tool-tip.
