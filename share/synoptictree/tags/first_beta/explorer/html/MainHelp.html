<h1>Welcome to the Device Tree</h1>

The Device Tree is a piece of software designed to be used in two modes,
a builder mode and a surveillance mode.

<h2>Surveillance mode</h2>

The Device Tree starts in surveillance-mode if it is started with a
file-name as argument. This file should contain attributes and
commands for the explorer to display. When the Device Tree is in
surveillance mode, it consists of a <a
href="MenuBarHelp.html">menubar</a>, a <a
href="ToolBarHelp.html">toolbar</a>, an <a
href="AttributeTableHelp.html">attribute table</a>, and a <a
href="CommandTableHelp.html">command table.
<p>
In surveillance mode, the user has the possibility to start and stop
the refreshing of attributes, to set the attributes and their
properties, and to execute commands. It is also possible to run
predefined java-applications on the devices present in the tables.

<h2>Administrator mode</h2>
</a>
If the Device Tree is started with no argument, it is started in
administrator mode, which gives the user an aditional graphical
element to use, the <a href="DeviceTreeHelp.html">device tree</a>
which lets the user browse all the devices on the system, as well as
populate the command and attribute table with commands and attributes
from the system.
