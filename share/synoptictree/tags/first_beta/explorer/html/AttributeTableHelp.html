<h2>Attribute table</h2>

The attribute table consists of a table with attributes. The
attributes come in three formats, scalars, spectrums, and images. The
value of the attributes are shown in separate tabs for the spectrums
and the images, whereas the scalar-values are shown directly in the
table.

The device field is used to indicate the state of the corresponding
device with predefined colours and the state of the device is also
available as a tool-tip.
The quality of the attributes are available as colours on the
name-field, and the name of the quality is available as a tool-tip.
