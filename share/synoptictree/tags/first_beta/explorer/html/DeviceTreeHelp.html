<h2>The devicetree</h2>

The devicetree will show you all available devices on your system with
their corresponding attributes and commands. By expanding the nodes
you will arrive at the attributes and commands, which you can drag and
drop into their corresponding table.
<br>
If your platform doesn't support drag and drop, you can right-click on
a selected node and choose "add to table" to do the same.
