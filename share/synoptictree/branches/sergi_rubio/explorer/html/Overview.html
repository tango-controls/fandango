<h2>3 - The Different ways to start Device Tree:</h2>
	<h3>3.1 - The "Stand Alone" starting:</h3>
		<p>
			This is the most used one. Just launch the devicetree script (main class is <code>explorer.Main</code>),
			following instructions in the <i><b><a href="#start">1 - Getting started:</a></b></i> section.
		</p>
	<h3>3.2 - The "Not Stand Alone" starting:</h3>
		<p>
			This case comes when you want to start Device Tree through another application.<br>
			Let's see how you can start the two different modes as "Not Stand Alone":
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Administrator mode:</b><br>
				To use this mode, instanciate a <code>new explorer.AdminMain()</code>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>User mode:</b><br>
				To use this mode, instanciate a <code>new explorer.ViewerMain(<i>filename</i>)</code>, where
				<code><i>filename</i></code> is a <code>String</code> that represents the path of the device tree file you want
				to start your user mode with.
			</li>
		</ul>
