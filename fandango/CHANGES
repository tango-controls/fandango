November 2011 - 9.00 : LIMITED COMPATIBILITY WITH PREVIOUS RELEASES
------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes by Tiago: dynamic/objects/dicts: compatible with Tango 7.2.2. Staticmethod decorators removed from Dynamic calls as they are no longer needed; now any decorator has to be wrapped in order to be recognized. Single-line method declaration with decorators is no longer allowed (may affect DynamicCommands?).
This change is no backwards compatible, so an "if PyTango.__version__ ..." has been added to enable/disable USE_STATIC_METHODS in fandango.dynamic module
dynamic: get_DynDS_properties and __init__ refactored to load default values also for class properties and do a better parsing of property types.
dynamic: improved logging and comments parsing in dyn_attr
dynamic: locks added to check_state to avoid recursive calls from DynamicStates evaluation
dynamic: added FILE(...) command to formulas to allow .csv file parsing
device: bug solved when dictionaries in TangoEval are empty
qt: patched an error in QCustomTabWidget
qt: added DictToolBar and QGridTable classes
servers: solved a bug in load_from_servers_list() method
tango: added methods to manage attribute labels

__init__: default imports reduced
dynamic: Modified get_DynDS_properties to respect Default values assigned in subclasses

able to switch between Tau and Taurus 
Dev4Tango capable of reading dynamic attributes from other devices within the same server.

 dynamic: 
assigning default property values in DynamicDS init 
KeepAttributes, KeepTime, CheckDependencies refactored 

 log: 
to avoid duplicity of traces with Tau logging the default output (logging or print) can be set using init(use_print=bool) argument. It is set as True by default. 

 objects: 
Pool class moved to threads module 

 qt: 
DoubleClickable decorator added 
TangoHostChooser added 

 threads: 
SingletonWorker, Pool and AsynchronousFunction classes added 

 servers: 
Added logger argument to ServersDict()

KeepTime / KeepAttributes / CheckDependencies properties
--------------------------------------------------------

The values of dynamic attributes will be kept in *dyn_values* dictionary if **KeepAttributes** is equal to '*', 'yes' or 'true'; or if the attribute name appears in the property.

For each **read_dyn_attr(Attribute)** call the values will not be recalculated if interval between read_attribute calls is < **KeepTime** (1s by default).

**ChekDependencies** (True by default) will force a check of which attributes are accessed in other's formulas, creating an index for each attribute with its pre-requisites for evaluation (which will be automatically assigned to be kept). At each *read_dyn_attr* execution the dependency values will be added to *_locals*, and a *read_dyn_attr(dependency)* may be forced if its values are older than **KeepTime**.
