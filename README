---------------------------------------------------
Fandango, functional tools for Tango Control System
---------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Fandango is a Python module created to simplify the configuration of big control systems; implementing the behavior of Jive (configuration) and/or Astor (deployment) tools in methods that could be called from scripts using regexp and wildcards.

It has been later extended with methods commonly used in some of our python API's (archiving, CCDB, alarms, vacca) or generic devices (composers, simulators, facades).

Fandango python modules provides functional methods, classes and utilities to develop high-level device servers and APIs for Tango control system.

Fandango is published using the same licenses than other TANGO projects; the license will be kept up to date in the LICENSE file.

Authors
=======

Fandango library was originally written by Sergi Rubio Manrique for the ALBA Synchrotron. Later authors will be acknowledged in the AUTHORS file

Features
========

This library provides submodules with utilities for PyTango device servers and applications written in python:

    functional: functional programming, data format conversions, caseless regular expressions
    tango: tango api helper methods, search/modify using regular expressions
    dynamic: dynamic attributes, online python code evaluation
    server: Astor-like python API
    device: some templates for Tango device servers, TangoEval for fast "tango code" evaluation.
    interface: device server inheritance
    db: MySQL access
    dicts,arrays: advanced containers, sorted/caseless list/dictionaries, .csv parsing
    log: logging
    objects: object templates, singletones, structs
    threads: serialized hardware access, multiprocessing
    linos: some linux tricks
    web: html parsing
    qt: some custom Qt classes, including worker-like threads.
    ... 

Main Classes
============

    DynamicDS/DynamicAttributes
    ServersDict
    TangoEval
    ThreadDict/SingletoneWorker
    TangoInterfaces(FullTangoInheritance) 

 
Where it is used
================

Several PyTango APIs and device servers use Fandango modules:

    PyTangoArchiving
    PyPLC
    SplitterBoxDS
    PyStateComposer
    PySignalSimulator
    PyAlarm
    CSVReader
    ... 

 
Requirements
============

    It requires PyTango to access Tango
    It requires Taurus to use Tango Events.
    Some submodules have its own dependencies (Qt,MySQL), so they are always imported within try,except clauses. 

Downloading
===========

Fandango module is available at sourceforge:

svn co https://tango-cs.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tango-cs/share/fandango/trunk fandango.src
